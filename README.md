# Customer-Segmentation
Performed exploratory data analysis on customer dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze features like age, gender, income, and spending score. 
Created insightful plots to understand data distributions.
Applied K-Means clustering algorithm (from scikit-learn) to group customers into distinct segments based on attributes like age, income, and spending habits.
Determined the optimal number of clusters (k) using the elbow method by analyzing inertia vs number of clusters.
Profiled and described the identified customer segments based on the clustering model to understand their key characteristics.
Visualized the clustered data in a 3D scatter plot using Matplotlib to represent customer segments across age, income, and spending score features.
Implemented end-to-end customer segmentation pipeline in Python from loading data, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and profiling.
Followed CRISP-DM process by moving from a business understanding of the problem to data understanding, data prep, modeling, and evaluation.
Demonstrated ability to apply unsupervised learning techniques like clustering to solve real-world problems using Python data science libraries.
